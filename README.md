# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ðŸŽ¨ Figma Design Files

This project includes the original Figma design files used during the **Little Lemon Reservation System** UX/UI process.  
You can find them inside the [`design-files/figma-files`](./design-files/figma-files) folder.

### ðŸ“‚ Included Files:
- `JourneyMap.fig` â†’ Customer journey mapping  
- `Little Lemon reservation.fig.fig` â†’ High-fidelity prototype  
- `Little lemon resv wirframe.fig.fig` â†’ Wireframes  
- `Persona.fig` â†’ User persona profiles  
- `The Problem.fig` â†’ Problem statement & design brief  

These files document the **design thinking process**: from understanding the user and problem â†’ to ideating solutions â†’ to prototyping.  

> ðŸ’¡ To view these files, import them into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (File â†’ Import).

Setup GitHub Repo

Installed Git & logged in.

Initialized local repo and connected to GitHub (git init, git remote add origin).

Fixed push issues (git push -u origin main --force).

Pushed React App Code

Added all project files with git add ..

Committed with "Initial commit: Little Lemon Reservation frontend".

Pushed to GitHub main branch.

Added Figma Design Files

Created design-files/ folder.

Added .fig files (JourneyMap, Wireframe, Persona, Problem).

Fixed path issues and committed them properly.

Renamed messy folder names â†’ design-files/figma-files for clarity.

Repo Cleanup & Consistency

Renamed folders with git mv.

Ensured files were tracked properly.

Verified everything with git push.

README Improvements

Kept Create React App instructions for devs.

Added ðŸŽ¨ Figma Design Files section for UX documentation.
What you learned (Git basics, repo structuring, documenting design).

Next steps (maybe deployment to Vercel/Netlify ðŸš€).
